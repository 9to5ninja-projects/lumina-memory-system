## Deployment Steps

### 1. System Preparation
```bash
# Create storage directories
mkdir -p ./storage/primary
mkdir -p ./storage/backup
mkdir -p ./storage/cache
mkdir -p ./storage/logs

# Set appropriate permissions
chmod 755 ./storage/primary
chmod 755 ./storage/backup
chmod 755 ./storage/cache
chmod 755 ./storage/logs
```

### 2. Configuration Deployment
```bash
# Copy configuration file
cp FINAL_PRODUCTION_CONFIG.json /path/to/deployment/config.json

# Validate configuration
python -m lumina_memory --validate-config config.json
```

### 3. System Startup
```bash
# Start the system
python -m lumina_memory --config config.json

# Verify startup
curl /health
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Health check returns 200 OK
- [ ] Metrics endpoint is accessible
- [ ] Logs are being written
- [ ] Memory usage is within limits
- [ ] Operations are processing correctly

---

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Daily Checks
- [ ] Check system health: `curl /health`
- [ ] Monitor memory usage (target: < 500 MB)
- [ ] Check operation latency (target: < 50 ms)
- [ ] Verify cache hit rate (target: > 80%)

### Weekly Maintenance
- [ ] Review log files in `./storage/logs`
- [ ] Check storage usage and cleanup if needed
- [ ] Verify backup integrity
- [ ] Review performance metrics

### Monthly Maintenance
- [ ] Rotate encryption keys (every 90 days)
- [ ] Archive old logs (retention: 30 days)
- [ ] Performance optimization review
- [ ] Security audit

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **High Memory Usage**
   - Check cache size configuration
   - Monitor for memory leaks
   - Consider reducing batch size

2. **Slow Operations**
   - Check storage I/O performance
   - Verify cache hit rate
   - Consider increasing cache size

3. **Storage Issues**
   - Verify disk space availability
   - Check file permissions
   - Monitor storage paths

4. **Consciousness Integration Issues**
   - Verify CPI subscale weights
   - Check consciousness battery initialization
   - Monitor CPI consistency scores

### Emergency Procedures

1. **System Shutdown**
   ```bash
   # Graceful shutdown (timeout: 30s)
   python -m lumina_memory --shutdown
   ```

2. **Configuration Reload**
   ```bash
   # Reload configuration without restart
   python -m lumina_memory --reload-config
   ```

3. **Backup Restoration**
   ```bash
   # Restore from backup
   python -m lumina_memory --restore-backup /path/to/backup
   ```
